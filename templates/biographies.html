<h1 style="font:bold;">Michael Jordan</h1>
<p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ, is an American retired professional basketball </br>player, businessman, and principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets. Jordan played 15 seasons in the National </br>Basketball Association (NBA) for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. His biography on the NBA website states: "By acclamation, </br>Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time." Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his </br>generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.</br>



Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels'</br> national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick. He quickly </br>emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks </br>from the free throw line in slam dunk contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness. He also gained a reputation </br>for being one of the best defensive players in basketball. In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and </br>followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a "three-peat". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball </br>before the beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season to pursue a new venture in minor league baseball, he returned to the Bulls in March </br>1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the </br>1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999, but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a </br>member of the Wizards.</p>

<h2 style="font:bold;">Lebron James</h2>,
<p>LeBron Raymone James (born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the </br>National Basketball Association (NBA).

James played high school basketball at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was highly promoted </br>in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall </br>pick of the 2003 NBA draft. James led Cleveland to the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2007, losing to the San Antonio </br>Spurs. In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in a highly publicized ESPN special titled The Decision. James played four </br>seasons for the Heat, reaching the Finals all four years and winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, he led </br>Miami on a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in league history. Following his final season with the Heat, James opted out </br>of his contract and re-joined the Cavaliers.
